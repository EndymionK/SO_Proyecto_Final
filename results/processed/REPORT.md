# Proof-of-Work Miner: Experiment Report
**Date:** 2025-11-09 18:47:55

## System Information
- **PC Name:** ANDRESPC
- **User:** andre
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700X 8-Core Processor             
- **CPU Cores:** 8
- **Logical Processors:** 16
- **Total Memory:** 31.93 GB
- **Operating System:** Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200

## Experiment Configuration
All experiments were executed using configurations from `experiments/configs/`:
- **Modes tested:** Sequential, Concurrent (with CPU pinning), Parallel
- **Threads:** 1, 2, 4 (varies by mode)
- **Difficulty:** 16 bits (low), 20 bits (medium)
- **Repetitions per config:** 30
- **Timeout:** 60-120 seconds
- **Seed:** 42

## Results Summary
Detailed results are available in:
- `results/processed/summary.csv` â€” Aggregated throughput, speedup, efficiency
- `results/processed/stats_summary.csv` â€” Statistical tests (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, pairwise comparisons)
- `results/processed/stats_summary.txt` â€” Human-readable statistical analysis
- `results/processed/plots/` â€” Throughput and speedup graphs

### Key Findings
(Review the plots and summary CSV for detailed analysis)

- **Sequential baseline:** Establishes reference throughput (hashes/s)
- **Parallel mode:** Expected to show speedup scaling with thread count
- **Concurrent mode:** CPU pinning forces threads to share a single core; used to study scheduling overhead vs parallelism

### Statistical Analysis
The `stats_summary.txt` file includes:
- ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing modes at each thread count
- Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction
- Evaluation of whether differences in throughput between modes are statistically significant

## Conclusion
This experiment validates the implementation of the three execution modes and provides empirical data on:
- Scalability of parallel execution
- Overhead introduced by concurrency with CPU pinning
- Relationship between difficulty, thread count, and throughput

For detailed methodology and analysis, refer to the project documentation in `instrucciones.md` and `README.md`.
